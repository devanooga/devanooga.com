A good place to get your feet wet and ask all kinds of questions as to where to start on a subject new to you, or for clarification on things that may be confusing.

Remember: we're all newbies on one topic or another, so all experience levels are welcome. Chances are you'll have as much to learn as you will to help others.

This channel is *usually* for less language-specific questions (eg: learning about classes vs. learning about C#), but feel free to ask here anyway.
